Angular Counter Exercise
This exercise is all about learning to create components and how to use bindings and directives. The goal is to make students proficient with using components, bindings and directives.

Objectives
Learn how to use components
Create views with components
Create templates for views
Modify NgModules
Describe how property and event bindings work
Create the Super Auto Counter
This exercise is connected to the Angular Directives exercise. Here we're just creating the counter page, but the follow-on lesson will have students add counters.

The final lab goal is to create the Super Auto Counter! Inspiration: https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/

The Super Auto Counter has the following feature summary:

Create counters
Auto create super counters from current counters
Auto create counters over time
The lab contains step by step instructions and stories for students use to complete the final product.

Setup
Option 1: Clone this repository (recommended)

cd ngcounter
npm install
ng serve --open
Option 2: From scratch

ng new ngcounter
cd ngcounter
ng serve --open
The application should launch on localhost:4200 in your default browser.

Details
This exercise is about getting to know the fundamentals of components by building a simple Counter app. The app allows users to create a counter with the simple click of a button. Each counter has 2 buttons: one to increase the count and another to decrease the count.

The instructor will first do a walk-thru/code-a-long of this exercise to get you started. Take notes and learn the fundamentals. At each stage you'll have an opportunity to try what you've learned.

After the walk-thru you'll have to complete the items below. Focus on understanding components, bindings and directives to keep yourself on track. There's lots to learn about Angular and this lesson is to make you good with components.

Creating Components
CounterListComponent

This component will be responsible for:

Creating new Counters
Displaying Counter instances in a grid
To create it, run: ng generate component counter-list

...which generates the following module with files:

app/counter-list/counter-list.component.ts
app/counter-list/counter-list.component.css
app/counter-list/counter-list.component.html
app/counter-list/counter-list.component.spec.ts
AppModule
Every time a new component is added to the application, AppModule must also be updated. Specifically, the NgModule decorator must declare all components that the app depends on. In this case, CounterListComponent and CounterDetailComponent should each be added to the declarations array.

You'll also need to import FormsModule and add it to the imports of NgModule. This will allow access to the @Input() object which will come in handy during this exercise.

Exercise
Time to use your new knowledge of components, bindings and directives to add some new features to build the Super Counter. You're not limited to the components and classes below.

Some guidelines:

Your final app should be responsive and well designed. No ugly apps; sculpt your CSS and HTML.
You can use your own CSS designs or a framework of your choice.
CounterListComponent

tracks how many counters are on the page
has limit 10 on how many counters can be created
CounterDetailComponent

has a counter
has an increment event that increases counter.value by 1 per click
has an decrement event that decreases counter.value by 1 per click
displays individual counters
Counter (class)

has a single property: value
SuperCounterComponent

is automatically created when 6 counters have been created
has levels
level 1: increments/decrements in multiples of 3
level 2: consumes 3 super counters; has 'start' button; auto increments +1 every second after 'start' is clicked
level 3: consumes 6 super counters; has no buttons; +2 per second automatically
has different color based on counter level
is twice the size of normal counters
has value equal to the sum of the 6 counters it combined
makes a sound when created
StatsComponent

has counter count
has super counter count
has clicks per second average (based on auto counters)
